- Better understand the OpenAI paper:
    - L(N) and L(c) 
    - N2G
    - ablation loss
- Better match the OpenAI implementation:
    - architecture
        - Increase latent size, k
        - Use tokens in later layers like the ~15th (out of 20) layer
    - evaluation:
        - Use better metric (ablation loss?)
        - Use normalized MSE
    - optimization
        - Use gradient clipping 
        - Increase batch size
